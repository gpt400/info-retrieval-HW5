          <p>A 3-by-8-inch 3D-printed building model was tested in a cutting-edge wind tunnel in the <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/research-overview/facilities-and-resources/hessert-laboratory-for-aerospace-research-and-hessert-at-white-field/">Hessert Laboratory</a> for Aerospace Research on Notre Dames campus, thousands of miles and several millennia from the ancient Greek building the model represents.</p>

          <p>Rather than evaluating the turbulence caused by a new turbine or wing design, the engineers were measuring wind loads to determine the structural stability of an ancient building that <a href="https://architecture.nd.edu/faculty/alessandro-pierattini/">Alessandro Pierattini</a> considers the precursor of classical architecture  the Toumba building at Lefkandi.</p>

          <blockquote class="pull"><p>&ldquo;The most characteristic feature of the Greek temple is its columns; there is a central structure surrounded by columns on all four sides.&rdquo;<cite>- Alessandro Pierattini</cite></p></blockquote>

          <p>Pierattini, an architectural historian, created a research team called the Interdisciplinary Study of Historical Architecture (ISHA) Lab to prove that the Toumba building is in fact the earliest known structure in Greece that led centuries later to the prominent columns of the classical Greek temple.</p>

          <p>To picture this iconic style, think of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/linc/index.htm">Lincoln Memorial</a> in Washington, D.C., and its central shrine and statue with a row of columns all around it. The Lincoln Memorial is modeled after the famous Parthenon ruins in Athens, Greece.</p>


          <p>&ldquo;The Greek temple is one of the most enduring and influential icons in many disciplines of the humanities  in archaeology, art, history, architectural history,&rdquo; Pierattini said. &ldquo;The most characteristic feature of the Greek temple is its columns; there is a central structure surrounded by columns on all four sides.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>But why test a model of the Toumba building for wind loads and stability?</p>

          <p>Pierattini said there has been a long-standing question of who invented the idea of building a temple with columns all around it  what is called the peristyle that characterizes classical architecture. Some have hypothesized that the Greeks learned the concept from similar temples in Egypt thousands of years earlier.</p>

          <figure class="image-right">
            <img loading="lazy" class="animate" src="images/lefkandi-diagram.jpg" alt="An illustration of a small building with dotted lines flowing over the roof to show wind movement." width="800" height="532">
            <figcaption class="animate">Schematic showing the wind load analysis principle on a model of the Toumba building at Lefkandi.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>But Pierattinis mentor, Oxford and Edinburgh architectural historian <a href="https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/news/jim-coulton-1940-2020">Jim Coulton</a>, in 1993 drew a reconstruction based on the ruins of a large building at <a href="https://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/lefkandi">Lefkandi</a> on the Greek island of Euboea. While few traces remained of the wood and thatch building discovered in the 1980s, Coulton used evidence of post holes around the perimeter to establish it as the earliest-known local antecedent of the peristyle of later Greek temples.</p>

          <p>At more than 160 feet long and 45 feet wide, the structure is 10 times larger than other known buildings from this period. Archaeologists believe it was used as a wealthy couples home before becoming their burial site, including jewelry and sacrificed horses.</p>

          <p>Because the Toumba building dates back to the 10th century B.C., experts believe it could not have been copied from Egyptian temples. While there is evidence of contact between the earlier Bronze Age Egyptians and Greeks, none is found during what was called the Greek Dark Age between 1100 B.C. and a period of growth starting in the eighth century B.C.</p>

            <figcaption class="animate">Pompilos/Wikimedia Commons/CC by SA 3.0</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Scholars widely accepted that this gap proved that the Greeks did not copy the peristyle from Egypt. The Toumba building was the missing link proving the Greeks developed the classical style on their own.</p>

          <p>Until 2015. Thats when architectural historian Georg Herdt published a study questioning the evidence of a peristyle based on a structural analysis of the Toumba building. Herdt determined that the interior posts could not have supported the height Coulton calculated, and that the exterior posts could have been from a surrounding fence.</p>

          <p>A debate has divided the field since.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;If it was not the first-known peripteral building, then the question is still open: Who invented the peristyle?&rdquo; Pierattini said. &ldquo;It really changes the importance this building has to the whole of Greek archaeology and history.&rdquo;</p>

            <img loading="lazy" class="animate" src="images/lefkandi-lab-800.jpg" srcset="images/lefkandi-lab-800.jpg 800w, images/lefkandi-lab-1200.jpg 1200w, images/lefkandi-lab-1600.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 75vw, 100vw" alt="Aerospace engineers Gianluca Blois and Mitsugu Hasegawa stand together in front of the wind tunnel discussing wind tunnel analysis results." width="800" height="566">
            <figcaption class="animate">Aerospace engineers Gianluca Blois and Mitsugu Hasegawa discuss wind tunnel analysis results.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Two years ago, Pierattini put together the ISHA Lab to resolve this debate. It includes aerospace research professor <a href="https://ame.nd.edu/faculty/gianluca-blois/">Gianluca Blois</a>; structural engineering professors <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/james-e-alleman/">James Alleman</a>, <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yahya-c-kurama/">Yahya Kurama</a> and <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/brad-weldon/">Brad Weldon</a>; and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dimitrios-Fytanidis">Dimitrios Fytanidis</a>, an external collaborator from the University of Illinois and Argonne National Laboratory.</p>

          <p>The team re-evaluated Herdts structural analysis, which did not include wind loads.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;We adopted what is called a finite element structural analysis software, which is the one that engineers use in modern applications,&rdquo; Pierattini said. &ldquo;And we include the wind in our model to evaluate the structural behavior of this building.&rdquo;</p>

          <figure class="image-right">
            <img loading="lazy" class="animate" src="images/lefkandi-model.jpg" alt="3D printed models of the Toumba building. They are black and about 8 inches long and a few inches tall." width="800" height="533">
            <figcaption class="animate">3D-printed models of the Toumba building at Lefkandi by Adam Heet (Hesburgh Libraries).</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Using a 3D-printed scaled model of the building with the taller roof supported by the peristyle, Blois and colleagues <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/hirotaka-sakaue/">Hirotaka Sakaue</a> and <a href="http://sites.nd.edu/sakaue-lab/people/">Mitsugu Hasegawa</a> generated experimental data in a Hessert Lab wind tunnel, increasing the speeds at different angles to determine the push and pull factors from wind around the model. Fytanidis plugged this experimental data into a numerical model to determine what wind loads the building could withstand.</p>

          <p>Then the structural engineers assessed the structural behavior of different variables  such as whether the wooden posts were latched together with ropes and whether the walls were wood or adobe bricks. They developed different estimates, from worst- to best-case scenarios.</p>

          <blockquote class="pull"><p>&ldquo;Surprisingly, even by modern standards, this building was really well designed. It was certainly stable even to relatively strong winds.&rdquo;<cite>- Alessandro Pierattini</cite></p></blockquote>

          <p>&ldquo;It was fascinating,&rdquo; Blois said. &ldquo;Ive been involved in fundamental research, where its just about understanding the physics. We also do a lot of applied research, where someone wants to manufacture something. You give me 10 different shapes and Ill tell you which one performs the best. Our research looks into the future.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>&ldquo;But its very unusual for engineers to look at something that has implications for history. Looking backward felt different, although we use the exact same rigor and the same approach.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>While the Toumba building with a peristyle and high roof would not withstand hurricane winds, it was remarkably strong.</p>

          <figure class="image-left">
            <img loading="lazy" class="animate" src="images/lefkandi-green-wind-tunnel.jpg" alt="A green laser reveals the Toumba model inside a wind tunnel. You can see the wind tunnel fan in the background." width="800" height="532">
            <figcaption class="animate">A laser sheet reveals the air flow around the Toumba model inside a wind tunnel.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Considering both wind and the load of the roof, it turned out to be more than stable, Pierattini said. Surprisingly, even by modern standards, this building was really well designed. It was certainly stable even to relatively strong winds. So, our experimental and numerical data demonstrated this building does deserve its place in every book of Greek architecture.</p>

          <p>Pierattini believes the structural data backs up what Coulton proposed about the alignment of the postholes. The outer and inner postholes form straight lines that suggest peristyle connections.</p>

          <p>The ISHA team presented preliminary data to an international group of experts in an online <a href="https://architecture.nd.edu/news-events/events/2022/05/09/the-toumba-building-at-lefkandi-preliminary-results-of-a-new-architectural-analysis/">colloquium</a> in May. Pierattini said more refined data will be presented at a future meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, and he is working on an article he hopes to publish next year in the peer-reviewed Annual of the British School at Athens, a top journal from Cambridge University.</p>

          <p>Im the author so Im obviously biased, but I think this will answer the question of whether this is the first-known peripteral building in Greek history, once it is published, Pierattini said. Its also interesting because we need to develop a common interdisciplinary language between architects, physicists and engineers. I imagine it will be very visual.</p>
