<p><strong>II. SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement explains how the University of California San Diego (&#8220;<strong>UC San Diego,</strong>&#8221; &#8220;<strong>we,</strong>&#8221; &#8220;<strong>us</strong>&#8221; or &#8220;<strong>our</strong>&#8221;) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal information (as defined below) in connection with our campus website <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">www.ucsd.edu</a> and other websites we own and operate that link to this Privacy Statement (the &#8220;<strong>Sites</strong>&#8221;), and the related content, platform, services, products, and other functionality offered on or through our Sites (collectively, the &#8220;<strong>Services</strong>&#8221;).</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement does not address our privacy practices related specifically to UC San Diego employees, students, or other affiliates, except where these individuals are interacting with UC San Diego Sites in their capacity as a member of the public.</p>

<p>When we collect personal information that is part of a student or an applicant&#8217;s educational record (&#8220;<strong>Student Data</strong>&#8221;), we collect, use, store, and otherwise process such information in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). To the extent that our processing practices in connection with Student Data differ from this Privacy Statement, the practices described in this Privacy Statement will not apply.</p>
<p>Except when operating the Preuss School and UC San Diego youth program and related Sites, our Services are not 1) directed to, 2) intended for, or 3) knowingly collecting or soliciting personal information from children under the age of 13.

In all instances, if we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, and in the case of youth programs without the parent or legal guardian consent, we will delete that personal information.</p>
<p>Our Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications.

<p><strong>1. LEGAL BASES FOR THE PROCESSING </strong></p>
<p>We may use your personal data based on the following legal grounds according to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the &#8220;<strong>EU GDPR</strong>&#8221;) or, where applicable, the &#8220;<strong>UK GDPR</strong>&#8221; as it forms part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of section 3 of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 GDPR:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perform our contractual services, including prior to entering into a contract with you</strong>. If you order or request Services from us or if you contact us to order or request our Services, we use your personal data to provide you with these Services, including for account and contract management, to facilitate user benefits and services, including customer support, and to evaluate your candidacy for employment or admittance and to facilitate the onboarding process.</li>
<li><strong>Justified by our legitimate interests</strong>. The usage of your personal data may also be necessary for our own business interests. For example, we may use some of your personal data to market our Services to individuals; administer, improve and personalize our Services, including by recognizing an individual and remembering their information when they return to our Services and analyzing our user-base; process payment for our Services; conduct market research; opportunity tracking, conversion, and lead generation; test, enhance, update, and monitor the services, or diagnose or fix technology problems; help maintain the safety, security and integrity of our property and services, technology assets and business; enforce our<strong> agreements,</strong> resolve disputes, carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, and protect our business interests and the interests and rights of third parties; and prevent, investigate or provide notice of fraud or unlawful or criminal activity.</li>
<li><strong>Consent</strong>. In some cases, we may ask you to grant us separate consent to use your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations</strong>. We are obligated to retain certain personal data because of legal requirements, for example, tax or commercial laws, or we may be required by law enforcement to provide personal data with a valid legal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table at <strong>Annex 1 </strong>and <strong>Annex 2</strong> set out further detail about the categories of personal data we collect about you, how we use that information when you use the Services, as well as the legal basis which we rely on to process the personal data and recipients of that personal data.</p>
<p>We may link or combine the personal data we collect about you and the information we collect automatically.</p>
<p>We may anonymize and aggregate any of the personal data we collect (so that it is no longer linked to you and does not identify you). We may use anonymized information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, and improving the Service. We may also share such anonymized and aggregated information with others.</p>
<p>Some information, such as your name, address, payment transaction information, and information on your requested services, may be necessary for your use of certain features and functionalities of the Service. If you choose not to provide personal data marked as mandatory, we may not be able to provide those aspects of the Service to you, or to respond to your questions and other requests.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>We generally store your personal data for the duration necessary for the data collection purposes identified by the specific UC application or program, unless we are required to do so to comply with applicable law or if we believe your personal data may be necessary to deal with a complaint or legal claim.</p>
<p><strong>3. MARKETING AND ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>We may contact you with information about our Services, including sending you marketing messages and asking for your feedback on our Services. For some marketing messages, we may use personal data we collect about you to help us determine the most relevant marketing information to share with you.</p>
<p><strong>4. STORING AND TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, change, or damage. All personal data we collect will be stored by our cloud hosting provider on secure servers. We will never send you unsolicited emails or contact you by phone requesting credit or debit card information or national identification numbers.</p>
<p><strong>International Transfers of your Personal Information</strong>. The personal data we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in where we and our third-party service providers have operations. If you are located in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland your personal data may be processed outside of those regions, including in the United States.</p>
<p>In the event of such a transfer, we ensure that: (i) the personal data is transferred to countries recognized as offering an equivalent level of protection; or (ii) the transfer is made pursuant to appropriate safeguards that require the recipient to treat the personal data in a manner that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in the country you are in. If you are located in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, these safeguards include entering into agreements that incorporate the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission and approved by the UK Information Commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>5. PROFILING AND AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING</strong></p>
<p>We may analyze personal data we have collected about you to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information that is relevant to you. We may make use of additional information about you when it is available from external sources to help us do this effectively. We may also use personal data about you to detect and reduce fraud and credit risk.</p>
<p>We may use your personal data for automated individual decision-making, in which case we will inform you of such processing activities and any potential impact of such processing activities.</p>
<p><strong>6. YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>

<li>information about the categories of recipients with whom we may share your personal data; and</li>
<li>a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Right of portability</strong>.

<li><strong>Right to rectification</strong>. You have the right to obtain rectification of any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold about you without undue delay.</li>
<li><strong>Right to erasure</strong>. You have the right, in some circumstances, to require us to erase your personal data without undue delay if the continued processing of that personal data is not justified. We may not be able to delete your information in all circumstances. We may be obligated to retain your personal information as required by law, regulation, or policy;</li>
<li><strong>Right to restriction</strong>. You have the right, in some circumstances, to require us to limit the purposes for which we process your personal data if the continued processing of the personal data in this way is not justified, such as where the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you.</li>
<li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong>. There are certain circumstances where we require your consent to process your personal data. In these instances, and if you have provided consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.

</ol>
