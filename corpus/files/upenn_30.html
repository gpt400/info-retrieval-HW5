<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="intro"></A>Campus Safety and Security: A Shared
Responsibility</H1>

<P>Campus safety and security at the University of Pennsylvania is a shared
responsibility. Clearly, the best protection against campus crime is an
aware, informed, alert campus community--students, faculty and staff who
use reason and caution--along with a strong law-enforcement presence.</P>

<P>The vast majority of our students, faculty, staff and visitors do not
experience crime at the University of Pennsylvania. However, crime sometimes
occurs despite our best efforts and yours. This information is provided
because of our commitment to campus safety and security and in compliance
with the Federal Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act and the Pennsylvania
College and University Security Information Act. It is meant to be useful
to you. If you have concerns, questions or comments about the requirements
of federal or state law or Penn's compliance with these laws, please contact
Thomas M. Seamon, Vice President&nbsp;for Public Safety, Division of Public
Safety, at (215) 898-7515. <B>Note</B>: The statistical information is amended
for 1996 and 1997.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ps"></A>The Division of Public Safety</H2>

<P>The Division of Public Safety is committed to enhancing the quality of
life of the campus community, integrating the best practices of public and
private policing with state-of-the-art security technology. Its 134 full-time
employees and 227 contract employees work in four departments:<B> University
Police, Special Services, Fire and Occupational Safety and Security Services.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The University Police Department</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>
</FONT>maintains police patrols 24 hours per day, seven days a week on campus--by
foot, car, motorcycle and bicycle--with a police force of 104 sworn officers,
the largest private police force in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. University
Police also work closely with the Philadelphia Police Department as both
agencies patrol and respond in neighborhood areas west to 43rd Street, south
to Baltimore Avenue, east to 30th Street and north to Market Street. University
Police officers have full enforcement powers, including the authority to
make arrests for criminal violations. While it is seldom necessary to use
force in their work, University Police officers are authorized to carry
firearms when on duty, and they do so. Otherwise, the possession of air
rifles or pistols, firearms, ammunition, gunpowder or other dangerous articles
or substances is strictly prohibited on Penn property or at University-sponsored
events.</P>

<P>University Police officers have completed rigorous training prescribed
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under the Municipal Police Officer's
Training Act. Once an officer has completed police academy training, he
or she participates in a Field Training Program, developed and coordinated
through the Division of Public Safety. Officers remain in probationary status
for one year following graduation from the police academy, and continuing
in-service training is provided in accordance with established standards
for continuing professional education for municipal police officers.</P>

<P>The Chief of the University Police serves as community liaison for the
Penn police department and coordinates all work with neighborhood town watch
organizations, community and civic groups, the Police Athletic League and
the Philadelphia Police Department.</P>

<P>The University Police department maintains a full-service detective unit
headed by the department's Deputy Chief of Investigations. Criminal incidents
are assigned to a detective within the University Police Detective unit,
who is responsible for the investigation of the crime or coordination with
the Philadelphia Police Department. If the incident involves a student who
has violated policies, procedures, codes of conduct or the law, the Penn
police will advise the victim or complainant of the option to report the
incident to the Office of Student Conduct or the responsible University
office. Pursuant to Pennsylvania's College and Universities Security Information
Act, information regarding the persons arrested by University Police is
available to the campus community.</P>

<P>The Detective Unit personnel are also specially-trained in crime prevention
techniques and provide more than 120 crime prevention seminars, forums and
other presentations each year to student groups, members of the faculty
and the staff. Self-defense clinics and other workshops or special presentations
can be designed to meet the particular needs of the group requesting services.
University Police personnel are available to consult with individuals or
departments regarding crime prevention and safety.</P>

<P>In addition, highly-trained personnel are available to offer assistance
and support to victims of a crime. Services include crisis intervention,
accompaniment to legal and medical proceedings and linkages to other University
and community resources.</P>

<P>To contact University Police <B>in an emergency, dial 511 from a campus
telephone, use one of more than 250 blue light emergency telephones on campus
and in the surrounding neighborhood or dial (215) 573-3333 from off-campus.
</B></P>

<P>The Communications Center (PennComm) of the Division of Public Safety
and all University Police vehicles monitor the radio frequency used by the
Philadelphia Police Department in its patrols of the area in and around
the campus. University Police officers respond to assist the Philadelphia
Police Department in certain situations, and they respond to those addresses
or locations owned by the University or associated with a recognized student
organization. University Police detectives also are in regular contact with
the 18th District of the Philadelphia Police Department to obtain information
on criminal incidents reported to the Philadelphia Police Department, but
not to University Police, for addresses or locations owned or controlled
by the University or associated with a recognized student organization.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Special Services Department </FONT></B>assists in
providing safety education and outreach programs, and coordinating victim
support services for the Division of Public Safety.</P>

<P>The department is headed by a Director of Special Services, who serves
as the University coordinator for support services when incidents of rape
or attempted rape, acquaintance rape, sexual or domestic violence or hate/bias
crimes occur. Hate/bias crimes include acts of violence or bias motivated
by racial, religious, sexual, ethnic or sexual-orientation bigotry. The
Director serves on various University committees that review and develop
policy on these and related issues. The Director also interacts with academic
departments, the Office of Housing and Residential Life, and many other
divisions across the University, given the individual's authorization, to
coordinate victim support services. Every effort is made to protect the
confidentiality of private information.</P>

<P>To contact the Special Services Department during normal business hours,
<B>call 8-4481 from a campus telephone or (215) 898-4481 from off-campus.
For emergency support 24 hours per day, seven days per week, call 8-6600
from a campus telephone or (215) 898-6600 from off-campus.</B> On evenings
or weekends, PennComm will answer all calls to 898-6600 and will notify
Special Services personnel.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Department of Fire and Occupational Safety </FONT></B>oversees
the University's fire and occupational safety programs, working in collaboration
with the City of Philadelphia Departments of Fire and Licenses and Inspections
to ensure that all University buildings are in compliance with local, state
and federal codes.</P>

<P>The Department, which is headed by a director, provides numerous additional
services, including safety training to new students and employees; new police
officer orientation; inspection and maintenance of fire extinguishers and
other safety equipment; review and inspection of all work-related injury
reports; maintenance of fire and safety code compliance; and, when requested,
will conduct off-campus living inspections and safety training.</P>

<P>Highly-trained personnel maintain fire and safety code compliance. The
department conducts special activities throughout campus for fire prevention
week, and designs and provides various promotional items for the community.</P>

<P>To contact the Department of Fire and Occupational Safety during normal
business hours, <B>call 8-6921 from a campus telephone or (215) 898-6921
from off-campus. To contact the department in an emergency, dial 511 from
a campus telephone, or dial (215) 573-3333 from off-campus. On evenings
or weekends, call the PennComm center at (215) 898-7297.</B></P>

<P>Security technologies and professional security officer services, combined
with effective community policing, are vital components of the Division
of Public Safety's programs to provide a safer campus environment. <B><FONT
 SIZE=+1>The Security Services Department </FONT></B>provides technical
expertise and planning to develop a state-of-the-art electronic security
infrastructure on campus. Currently, this includes emergency blue light
telephones, building alarm systems, electronic access control systems and
closed-circuit video monitoring for security purposes. The Security Services
Department designs and coordinates the installation and monitoring of the
technologies and provides campus-wide systems administration for electronic
security technologies.</P>

<P>The University of Pennsylvania retains SpectaGuard to provide skilled
security services on campus and in the surrounding neighborhood to supplement
its police force and the patrols provided by the Philadelphia Police Department.
Security officers may be assigned to conduct highly-visible security patrols
on and off-campus, to screen access to student residences and other buildings
and to provide security services at special events. SpectaGuard patrols--on
foot, by car and by bicycle--work in concert with both University Police
and the Philadelphia Police Department to patrol some streets in the surrounding
neighborhood in the evening hours. SpectaGuard officers also provide walking
escort services to Penn students and staff, from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m., seven
days a week.</P>

<P>In addition, the University City District (UCD), a special services district
which encompasses the University and its surrounding neighborhoods, employs
uniformed Safety Ambassadors who serve as additional eyes and ears in the
community. UCD Safety Ambassadors are in radio communication with the Penn
Police and the Philadelphia Police Department. Further, the Philadelphia
Police Department has dedicated additional personnel to patrol within the
UCD boundaries.</P>

<P>The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Medical School
use a separate uniformed security force that screens access and egress at
public entrances to buildings and provides routine patrols of these facilities
24 hours per day, seven days per week.</P>

<H2><A NAME="rept"></A>Reporting Crime</H2>

<P>The Communications Center (PennCom) of the Division of Public Safety
is maintained 24 hours per day, seven days a week. All criminal incidents
should be reported to the Division of Public Safety for response and documentation.
Incidents known in common parlance as Part I crimes that are identified
to the Division of Public Safety are reported to the Philadelphia Police
Department to ensure that all agencies charged with providing services are
aware of these incidents. The relationship and exchange of information with
city, state and federal authorities is extremely important, and it is an
ongoing process. The Philadelphia Police Department alerts the Division
of Public Safety to reported incidents in the surrounding neighborhoods
that are jointly patrolled by both University Police and the Philadelphia
Police Department.</P>

<P>To report a criminal incident,<B> dial 511 from a campus telephone, use
one of more than 250 blue light telephones on campus and in the community
or dial (215) 573-3333 from off-campus</B>. You also can report a criminal
incident in person at the Division of Public Safety, 4040 Chestnut St.,
which is staffed with professional personnel 24 hours a day, seven days
a week.</P>

<P>The University of Pennsylvania Police Department maintains a computerized
database for all reported criminal incidents, including those that occur
on campus, those that occur in the surrounding neighborhood and those that
occur well beyond the campus community. This data is the basis for crime
statistics reported to the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting System, for compliance
with the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act and the College and University
Security Information Act and for reporting crime statistics to the campus
community.</P>

<P>The Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act requires Penn to provide
information on its security policies and procedures and specific statistics
for criminal incidents and arrests on campus to students and employees and
to make the information and statistics available to prospective students
and employees upon request. The College and University Security Information
Act requires Penn to provide information on its security policies and procedures
to students, employees and applicants and to provide crime statistics to
students and employees and to make those statistics available to applicants
and prospective employees upon request. This information is available <B>by
calling the Division of Public Safety Communications Center (PennComm) at
(215) 898-7297.</B></P>

<P>All crimes against persons that occur on campus and in the surrounding
neighborhood, including the areas jointly patrolled by University Police
and the Philadelphia Police Department, are published in Almanac, the weekly
journal of record, opinion and news, published by the University of Pennsylvania.
The Division of Public Safety maintains an Incident Journal, a chronological
listing of all crimes reported to University Police, which is open for public
inspection at the Communications Center (PennComm) of the Division of Public
Safety.</P>

<P>The Division of Public Safety uses &quot;Crime Alerts&quot; to notify
the campus community of crimes that pose a threat to the community.</P>

<H2><A NAME="sex"></A>Acquaintance Rape and Sexual Violence</H2>

<P>For more than 20 years, the University of Pennsylvania has addressed
the issues of rape and sexual violence through firesides, seminars, forums
and other presentations. Students Together Against Acquaintance Rape (STAAR),
Penn's nationally recognized student-operated program, also addresses these
issues through its workshop programs. Penn also conducts educational and
training programs for its employees who interact with students, including
University Police officers, coaches and student service personnel in the
Office of University Life, members of the campus ministries and those who
provide services in the student residences.</P>

<P>Acquaintance rape is a form of sexual violence defined under our policy
as any act in which a person forces another person with whom he or she is
acquainted to engage in sexual activity against his or her will or without
his or her consent. Assent does not constitute consent if it is given by
a person who because of youth, mental disability or intoxication is unable
to make a reasonable judgment. This policy applies to groups as well as
individuals.</P>

<P>Penn will provide support for victims of acquaintance rape or sexual
violence, and it is committed to provide resources and processes for prevention,
education, reporting, adjudication, protection from retaliation and sanctions.
Incidents that are reported to the appropriate departments at Penn will
be addressed promptly and will be confidential. The procedures that govern
the investigation of charges under these policies will take into account
both the need to gather the facts and the rights of all parties involved
in the incident.</P>

<P>Anyone who is a victim of sexual violence or acquaintance rape at Penn
is encouraged to seek support and assistance and to report the incident.
While students are encouraged to <B>contact the Special Services Department
at 8-6600 from a campus telephone or (215) 898-6600 from off-campus, contact
also can be made through University Police emergency lines by dialing 511
from a campus telephone, by using one of more than 250 blue light telephones
on campus and in the community or by dialing (215) 573-3333 from an off-campus
telephone;</B> through contact with Counseling and Psychological Services
by dialing 8-7021 from a campus telephone or (215) 898-7021 from off-campus;
or through contact with the Penn Women's Center by dialing 8-8611 from a
campus telephone or (215) 898-8611 from off-campus.</P>

<P>When a victim of a sex offense contacts the Special Services Department,
the individual will be advised of all the health, legal and support services
available on and off campus, and the victim will be assisted in accessing
these services. If the victim elects to go through the criminal justice
system and/or receive medical treatment, personnel from Special Services
will accompany the victim to the sexual trauma unit at Jefferson Hospital
for evaluation, treatment and evidence collection. The Director of Special
Services at Penn is the designated coordinator of support services for students
who have been victimized. Whether the victim chooses to report an incident
of acquaintance rape or sexual violence to the Special Services Department,
the University Police Department or another resource center within the campus
community, the victim will be informed of all options for filing a complaint,
including the right to report the incident fully and completely to the Philadelphia
Police Department, the right to file an anonymous report with the Philadelphia
Police Department or the right to file no report.</P>

<P>Due to the sensitive issues involved in acquaintance rape and other sexual
assaults, the victim may first disclose the incident some time after it
has occurred, but the victim is nonetheless encouraged to contact Special
Services for support and assistance and to report the incident.</P>

<P>Those within the campus community who are found responsible for acquaintance
rape or other sexual violence are subject to University sanctions, which
may include suspension, expulsion or separation from the University. The
individual also may be subject to prosecution by the Office of the District
Attorney under Pennsylvania criminal statutes. In any University disciplinary
proceeding involving charges of sexual assault, the accused and the accuser
are entitled to the same opportunities to have others present during the
proceedings, and both the accused and the accuser are informed of the outcome
of the proceedings.</P>

<P>The Acquaintance Rape and Sexual Violence Policy is stated on pages 21-22
of the <I>PennBook: Resources, Policies &amp; Procedures Handbook</I>, which
is available through the Office of the Vice Provost for University Life
<B>by calling (215) 898-6081. </B></P>

<H2><A NAME="drugs"></A>Alcohol and Drugs</H2>

<P>The University of Pennsylvania and its programs and policies regarding
the possession, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages encourages all
within the campus community to make safe, responsible decisions about alcohol
that are consistent with existing state and federal law. The possession
or consumption of alcoholic beverages on campus by persons under the age
of 21 is strictly prohibited by Penn and by the laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania. Consistent with its educational mission, Penn provides
programs that promote awareness of the physical, psychological, social and
behavioral effects of alcohol consumption.</P>

<P>The use, sale or possession of narcotics and dangerous drugs is illegal
and is strictly prohibited on campus.</P>

<P>Employees are required to adhere to the University's Drug-Free Workplace
Policy and the Drug and Alcohol Policy, which strictly prohibit the unlawful
manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, possession or use of drugs
by its employees in the workplace. Those who violate these policies may
be subject to disciplinary procedures or may be required to participate
in drug or alcohol rehabilitation programs.</P>

<P>Students who have questions or concerns about alcohol or drugs are encouraged
to use the medical or counseling resources provided by the University of
Pennsylvania. These services adhere to all applicable laws governing the
confidentiality of patient information.</P>

<P>The Alcohol and Drug Policy is stated on page 25 of the <I>PennBook:
Resources, Policies &amp; Procedures Handbook, </I>which is available through
the Office of the Vice Provost for University Life <B>by calling (215) 898-6081.</B></P>

<H2><A NAME="policy"></A>Disciplinary Policies</H2>

<P>Any student who fails to comply with University policies or local, state
or federal laws may be subject to discipline under the University Code of
Student Conduct. Sanctions can include, but are not limited to, disciplinary
probation for a specified period of time, withdrawal of privileges, indefinite
probation, term suspension, indefinite suspension without automatic right
of re-admission and expulsion. When a student's presence on campus is considered
a threat to order, health or safety, the Provost or his or her designee
may impose a mandatory leave of absence or conditions on the student's attendance.</P>

<P>Generally, prospective students are not asked about previous criminal
records, with the exception of applicants to certain graduate and professional
programs, such as the Law School. Employees, however, are required to disclose
any and all convictions for a felony, crime of violence, dishonesty or crime
against property or involving the threat of violence in the past 10 years.
A criminal record, if relevant to the position in question, is a factor
considered in the employment process.</P>

<P>The University's disciplinary procedures are described on pages 14-21
of the <I>PennBook: Resources, Policies &amp; Procedures Handbook, </I>which
is available through the Office of the Vice Provost for University Life

program attempts to assign students to one of their top three choices. Students
applying after May 1, including transfer students, are processed in order
of the receipt of their application. Upper-class students are assigned housing
through a retention, lottery or special program process. Graduate and professional
students are assigned housing in the order of the receipt of their application.
Room changes are made during scheduled periods in October, December and
February, given availability of space. Emergency room changes can be made
at any time upon the recommendation of a member of the residence hall staff.</P>

<P>The University of Pennsylvania maintains three undergraduate college
houses, two graduate high-rise residences and one graduate low-rise residence
as open residences during the winter break between semesters. All other
residences are closed to students, who are welcome to stay in an open building
during the break.</P>

<P>Entrances to all student residences are either locked or closely monitored
by security personnel, and access to these facilities is limited to residents,
faculty, staff and authorized contractors, who are admitted only during
certain hours and only with valid identification. Access to most student
residences at Penn is monitored electronically by a card access system.
Those without a valid PENNCard are considered visitors and will be admitted
only after the presentation of valid identification and with the approval
of their hosts, who will be responsible for their conduct. All student rooms
are equipped with dead bolt or Mortis locks with anti-carding devices.</P>

<P>The Division of Public Safety is available to provide firesides, seminars,
forums and other presentations on campus safety and security to those living
in student residences. Campus safety and security is discussed as a matter
of course at residence hall meetings.</P>

<H2><A NAME="facil"></A>Use of Facilities</H2>

<P>The facilities at the University of Pennsylvania exist to house or support
the tripartite mission of the institution: teaching, research and service.
The use of these by University groups is permissible, given the facilities
are available, and by approved non-University organizations under certain
circumstances. Permission to use these facilities does not constitute University
endorsement of the activities. The policy on use of facilities is stated
on page 37 of the <I>PennBook: Resources, Policies &amp; Procedures Handbook,
</I>which is available through the Office of the Vice Provost for University
Life <B>by calling (215) 898-6081.</B> If you have questions on the use

<H2><A NAME="HUP"></A>The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</H2>

<P>The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) maintains a proprietary
security department that is committed to providing a safe and secure environment
in hospital facilities, and for its patients, staff and visitors. Security
officers are stationed at the major entrances to the hospital and engage
in regular patrols of the facilities. Officers respond to all requests for
assistance, whether routine or emergency. An Operations Center of the Security
Department is maintained 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and it monitors
the CCTV/Controlled Access System as well as safety and security alarms.</P>

<P>To contact the HUP Security Department in an emergency,<B> dial 2677
(COPS) from a hospital telephone or (215) 662-2677 from outside the hospital.
</B></P>

<P>Most of the hospital's population does not experience crime at HUP. However,
crime sometimes occurs despite our best efforts and yours. Security awareness
and the cooperation of all employees in reporting potential problems have
been invaluable.</P>

<H3>The Security Department</H3>

<P>The HUP Security Department consists of 41 employees divided into three
areas:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Security Administration</B> consists of the Director of Security,
  who is responsible for all functions of the HUP Security Department, as
  well as an investigator, an operations officer and a secretary, who also
  manages the Photo ID/Controlled Access System.</P>
  <P><B>Security Operations</B> consists of 37 uniformed officers on three
  shifts, all of whom are supervised by a sergeant with support by a corporal.
  The Security Operations Center is located on the ground floor of Silverstein
  Pavilion, just inside the entrance to the Emergency Room. Security Operations
  is responsible for providing safety and security services 24 hours per
  day, seven days per week, and it responds to requests for routine and emergency
  services. The lieutenant/operations officer has day-to-day responsibility
  for the Operations section.</P>
  <P><B>Crime Prevention and Investigations</B> is responsible for crime
  prevention programs, security surveys of hospital spaces and security information
  and education throughout the hospital. The investigator also is responsible
  for the investigation of all criminal matters.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The HUP Security Department has the same powers of arrest as any private
citizen and, when necessary, coordinates its activities with the University
Police Department and the Philadelphia Police Department.</P>

<H3>Reporting Crime at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</H3>

<P>All criminal incidents and requests for assistance should be reported
to the Security Operations Center. The HUP Security Department reports all
criminal activity as well as other data to the Hospital Safety Committee,
which reports data to the Health System Board of Trustees on a quarterly
basis. The HUP Security Department also reports criminal statistics to the
University of Pennsylvania Police Department.</P>

<P>To report a criminal incident at HUP, <B>dial 2677 (COPS) in an emergency
from a hospital telephone or (215) 662-2677 from outside the hospital.</B></P>

<H3>Access to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</H3>

<P>Security monitors all major entrances to HUP during normal hours; entrance
to HUP is restricted to the main entrance and the Emergency Room after hours.</P>

<H3>Security Education</H3>

<P>Crime prevention programs and security awareness education are presented
annually to the HUP staff and, when necessary, on a departmental basis.<BR>

<P>The Pennsylvania College and University Security Information Act requires
the release of crime statistics and rates to students and employees, and
it requires that those statistics be available to applicants and new employees
upon request. The rate is based on the actual number of Full Time Equivalent
(FTE) students and employees. The index in the table below is based on incidents
per 100,000 people. The University's FTE population for 1996 was 51,585,
for 1997 was 51,162 and for 1998 was 51,948.</P>

  at the University of Pennsylvania in 1996 and 1997. The Federal Crime Awareness
  and Campus Security Act, as amended by the Higher Education Reauthorization
  Act of 1998, requires the release of statistics by category of prejudice
  concerning the occurrence of hate crimes in the crime classifications listed
  above and for other crimes involving bodily injury to any person &quot;in
  which the victim is selected because of the actual or perceived race, gender,
  religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or disability of the victim.&quot;
  There was one hate crime, which was racially-motivated, reported at the

  <LI>&nbsp;The statistics for the period October 1, 1998, through December
  31, 1998, also are reflected in the aggregate shown for 1998.
  <LI>The Federal Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act, as amended by
  the Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998, defines <I>Campus</I>
  as &quot;any building or property owned or controlled by an institution
  of higher education within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area
  of the institution and used by the institution in direct support of, or
  in a manner related to, the institution's educational purposes, including
  residence halls; and property within the same reasonably contiguous geographic
  area of the institution and is owned by the institution but controlled
  by another person, is used by students, and supports the institutional
  purposes, such as a food or other retail vendor.&quot; <I>On-Campus Residential</I>
  is a sub-category of <I>Campus</I> showing the number of on-campus incidents
  that occur &quot;in dormitories or other residential facilities for students
  on campus.&quot; The new law defines <I>Non-Campus Building or Property</I>
  as any building or property owned or controlled by a student organization
  recognized by the institution; and any building or property, other than
  a branch campus, owned or controlled by an institution of higher education
  that is used in direct support of, or in relation to, the institution's
  educational purposes, is used by students, and is not within the same reasonable
  contiguous geographic area of the institution.&quot; It defines <I>Public
  Property</I> as &quot;all public property that is within the same reasonably
  contiguous geographic area of the institution, such as a sidewalk, a street,
  other thoroughfare or parking facility, and is adjacent to a facility owned
  or controlled by the institution if the facility is used by the institution
  in direct support of, or in a manner related to the institution's educational
  purposes.&quot;
