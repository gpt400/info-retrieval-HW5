 <h2>Building Access</h2><h3>Evanston Campus Building Access</h3><p>Your Wildcard is your key to campus. By carrying your Wildcard at all times, you help foster a secure environment and ensure a seamless experience with access to University buildings.</p>
<p>Northwestern has electronic locks on most exterior doors on the Evanston campus that can be accessed by using a valid&#160;<a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/wildcard/#students">Wildcard</a>. Beginning Aug. 31, 2023, Northwestern updated its campus building security efforts by establishing campus-wide standard building hours, subject to limited exceptions. The new standard is designed to emphasize safety while providing convenient access for students, staff, faculty and visitors.</p><div class="expander" data-collapse="data-collapse"><h4>Standard Building Hours</h4><div><h4>Weekdays</h4>
<p>7 a.m.&#8211;6 p.m. &#8211; Main entrance open. Electronically controlled doors accessible via Wildcard.&#160;</p>
<h4>Weeknights</h4>
<p>6 p.m.&#8211;11 p.m. &#8211; Electronically controlled doors accessible via Wildcard.</p>
<h4>Weekends and University Holidays</h4>
<p>7 a.m.-11 p.m. &#8211; Electronically controlled doors accessible via Wildcard.</p>
<h4>Every Night</h4>
<p>11 p.m.&#8211;7 a.m. &#8211; Entry limited to authorized people only.</p></div><h4>Key Terms</h4><div><h4>Main Building Entrance</h4>
<p>The main building entrance will be open and unlocked from 7 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday through Friday, subject to limited exceptions with alternate access protocols. Access is available to everyone, including students, faculty, staff and visitors. The main building entrance is generally street-facing and/or the most heavily utilized exterior door. Most main building entrances are Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible. See below for locations where an additional entrance will remain open and unlocked from 7 a.m.-6 p.m. to provide ADA access. Doors should never be propped open. Regardless of the time of day, both main and perimeter doors may be used for building egress.</p>
<h4>Perimeter Doors</h4>
<p>Northwestern community members can enter buildings through electronically controlled perimeter doors by&#160;using their Wildcards until 11 p.m., at which point access is limited to authorized people only. Regardless of the time of day, community members should remain vigilant when entering buildings through secured doors. Doors should never be propped open. Both main and perimeter doors may be used for building egress at all times.</p>
<h4>Interior Doors</h4>
<p>The standard building hours apply to the main building entrance and perimeter doors of a campus building. Interior doors, such as doorways to wings or suites in a building, may have different hours or authorization. Please contact your program director or supervisor if you need authorization to these interior locations.</p>
<h4>Building-Specific Authorization</h4>
<p>After 11 p.m., only authorized people will be allowed access to buildings via electronically controlled main building entrances and perimeter doors. Wildcards previously programmed with building-specific authorization will retain their access. Please contact your program director or supervisor if you need authorization to access a specific building after hours.</p>
<h4>Get 'N'<strong><br/></strong></h4>
<p>Your Wildcard is your key to campus. By carrying your Wildcard at all times, you help foster a secure environment and ensure a seamless experience with access to University buildings. Thank you for keeping our campus community secure.</p></div><h4>Accessibility</h4><div><p>Public-facing administrative and academic buildings have options for ADA accessible entrances with exterior push buttons. These exterior doors allow access with a valid Wildcard if needed.</p>
<p>If&#160;the main building entrance is not ADA accessible, an additional ADA accessible perimeter door will remain open and unlocked during these standard building hours&#160;from 7 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday through Friday. The push plates continue to open these specific accessible exterior doors for ADA access.</p>
<p>On weeknights, weekends, University holidays and after hours (if authorized for building-specific access), when all exterior doors are secured, Wildcard holders should unlock the ADA-accessible door with their Wildcard, then press the exterior push plate to open the door for ADA access. In the unlikely event that a push plate malfunctions, please contact Facilities Customer Service at 847-491-5201 (Evanston) or 312-503-8000 (Chicago) for after-hours assistance.</p>
<p>The following buildings will have an additional entrance that will remain open and unlocked from 7 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday through Friday to provide ADA access:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annie May Swift &#8211; ADA entrance is on the east side of the building, accessible via a ramp</li>
<li>Catalysis Center &#8211; ADA entrance is on the north side of the building, west of the main entrance, off South Tech Drive</li>
<li>Fisk Hall &#8211; ADA entrance is on the east side of the building, off the parking lot facing the Segal Visitors Center</li>
<li>Kresge Hall &#8211; ADA entrance is on the east side of the building, facing McCormick Foundation Center</li>
<li>Lunt Hall &#8211; ADA entrance is on the northeast side of the building, opposite of the main entrance, off Campus Drive</li>
<li>McCormick Foundation Center &#8211; two ADA entrances are on the south side of the building, facing Locy Hall and facing Crowe Hall</li>
<li>University Hall &#8211; ADA entrance is on the south side of the building, adjacent to the main entrance and accessible via a ramp</li>
</ul></div><h4>Troubleshooting Wildcard Access</h4><div><p>While main building entrances remain open and unlocked from 7 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday through Friday, you will encounter many electronically controlled perimeter doors that require a Wildcard for entry during these hours. As of Aug. 31, 2023, a valid Wildcard will be needed to access doors with card readers.</p>
<p>Please check the expiration date on your Wildcard to minimize a disruption in access. If you need to obtain, renew or replace your Wildcard, please schedule an appointment with the&#160;<a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/wildcard/">Wildcard Office</a>.</p>
<p>For building-specific authorization, please contact your program director or supervisor. The Wildcard Office cannot provide access to buildings.</p></div><h4>Buildings with Standard Building Hours</h4><div><p>The following buildings operate with standard building hours.

Regardless of the time of day, community members should remain vigilant when entering buildings through secured doors. Perimeter doors should never be propped open. Both main and perimeter doors may be used for building egress at all times.</p></div><h4>What does this mean for Evanston campus accessibility via building exterior doors?</h4><div><p>All valid Wildcards will unlock ADA accessible exterior doors of buildings operating on standard hours from 7 a.m. through 11 p.m. For access to specific interior devices (e.g., elevators, lifts, etc.) that are otherwise inoperable by the Northwestern University community without authorized approval, staff and faculty should contact the&#160;<a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/civil-rights-office/policies-procedures/accommodation/disability.html">Office of Civil Rights and Title IX Compliance</a>; students should contact&#160;<a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/accessiblenu/">AccessibleNU&#160;</a>(ANU).

After reserving a space, event organizers must complete this <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=YdN2fXeCCEekd2ToNmzRvEAQo2cXJItAvhOKz2S1jftUOTdGVE9YTUtUM00xV1FVRE1GRlI3SDJWRi4u">form</a> to request that the main entrances be unlocked if an event is scheduled after 6 p.m. or on the weekend and they <strong>intend to invite attendees outside the campus community. </strong></p>
<p>Reservation systems that service these spaces have incorporated guidance for requesting a building unlock in their reservation confirmation notifications.</p>
<p>Event requesters should allow up to 2 weeks for their requests to be reviewed.
